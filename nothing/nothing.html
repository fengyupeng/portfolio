          <p class="paragraph"> NoThing is an experimental modern luxury brand established by Chris Feng in June 2017. NoThing shifts its emphasis from the product itself to the feeling and philosophy behind the brand. The product itself, a handed-crafted decoration made from 100% natural material like wood and stone, has little practical use; however, the goal of this brand is to rekindle people’s affection for natural material and workmanship.

          NoThing is a luxury brand of the modern world. A very contemporary, even futuristic look for the logo is essential. I designed the typeface to be skinny and consisted of only straight lines. I made the stroke very thin to display an air of elegance. The upper part of the logo is the overlapping of the initials “N” and “T”. Although the products are “things”, they are much more than just things. They are the representation of the brand’s natural, crafted and modern identity.
