                    Chelsea Cookie Company(CCC) is an imaginary cookie compay
                    located in Chelsea Market, New York City. Chelsea Merket is
                    an indoor food hall known for its unique industrial character.
                    My task is to design a logo and branding for CCC that relate
                    to its product while also suit the overall industrial
                    feeling of Chelsea Market. My task also includes to make
                    the package design for CCC's cookie products.

                    As requested by the imaginery client, the deisgn of the
                    logo shall match with the industrial atmosphere of Chelsea
                    Market. It shall also consicely deliver the message implying
                     CCC's  primary product: cookie. On top of that, the logo
                     shall contain the name of the company CCC in it. The idea
                     of a bolt came to my mind.

                    I designed the packages for six different flavors of cookies:
                     Mango Flovor, Blueberry & Cream Flavor, Matcha Flavor,
                     Strawberry Flavor, M&M Flavor.  I then made 3D models of
                     the packages and rendered them in Cinema 4D.
