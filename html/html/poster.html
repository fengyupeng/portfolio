			<p>I AM A POSTER is one of my personal art/graphic design projects.
				It's goal is to remind people of their self-awareness and to be
				themselves. Because of the overwhelming popularity of computer
				science and related disciplines and the overall career-oriented
				culture, more and more students switch their major into computer
				science and related fields; clubs and events related to personal
				interests and spiritual life receive very little attention and
				support. To remind people to always be themselves and value their
				own characteristics, personalities, interests, hobbies and aspiration,
				I designed a series of "self-aware" posters showing off their
				individuality and personality. I printed out hundreds of
				these posters and put them everywhere on campus. Immediately,
				this project received a lot of attention and feedback.
				As putting posters on places other than poster boards is not allowed
				at Carnegie Mellon, I left a fake name Christopher Fungunaski on
				each poster.
