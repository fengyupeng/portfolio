                <p>
                    To design and build a mobile app called LiGo that allows college
                     students to navigate through and filter events on campus and
                     allows student organizations to post and advertise events.
                     I was mainly responsible for designing the logo, branding,
                     user experience and the user interface of LiGo.

                    We as a team worked togther on analyzing the social/economic
                    system LiGo lies in. We studied the "stakeholders" involved in
                    this system, what their values are and how they interact with
                    each other. I solely worked on the rendering of the system diagram.

                    Function comes from need and design comes from function.
                    After the function we wanted LiGo to achieve and the service
                    we want LiGo to provide were confirmed, I moved on and prototyped
                    the flow of how users interact with LiGo and created the
                    wireframes of the UI

                <p>
                    With a clear mind of how the interaction between users and the
                    app should take place, I then created the user interface.

                    Users can sign up as either individual students or student
                    organizations. Student organizations need to be authorized by the
                    school officials, the Bridge at Carnegie Mellon for instance.

                    Each icon represents a different type of event. For instance,
                    the purple one with a video game controller marks the type
                    "entertainment" while the blue one with a  pencil on it means
                    "education". The combination of using a map and color-coded icon
                     displays both the physical location and the basic info of a
                     event in a single interface. Inside the menu, users are able
                     to sort events by either type of events or starting time/date
                     of events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once a sorting criteria is entered, it takes the user back
                    to the map inteface with more detail information related to the
                    event. By clicking on each single event, it takes the user to
                    the detailed description interface where the user can click
                    "Go" and "Save". By clicking "Go", a message would be sent to
                    the host of the event so that the hosts can know how much people
                    are coming even before the event starts.
