          Sorting the projects by activities and relevance in real time brings up a new problem: users might have trouble identifying specific projects when multiple ones are going on simutaneously.</br>
          The colored bookmarks solves this problem. Users can choose to bookmark certain projects with different color. This way different projects are more identifiable as human eyes recognize color much faster than text.
